## **Purpose:** Build a list of the Brands among the Interbrand List 100 and its presence on different Platforms (i.e. Social Media) finding relevant accounts from the brands.

### Mise en Place

**Step 1:** Open the List the 100 Best brands from the website [Interbrand List 100](https://interbrand.com/best-global-brands/)

**Step 2:** Open the Tracker [Google Sheet Tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lHqnN_SgrIcZApbZTWd7RXDCk2KPVA0MZT-mWVsYNuM/edit?usp=sharing)

**Step 3:** Select from the list the next Brand and Fill the Colummns starting from the first platform on the hierarchy (i.e. PL List tab)
    
		Note: Start with the next brand in the list so we don't do each others work.
